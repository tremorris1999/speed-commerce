# Product
## Functionality
The products module needs to implement the following behaviors:
- [x] Retrieve all products matching an optional arbitrary filter (pagination to be explored later).
- [x] Retrieve an individual product given its ObjectId.
- [x] Insert a single product into the database and return its newly generated ObjectId.
- [x] Update a single product given its ObjectId.
- [x] Delete a single product given its ObjectId.
