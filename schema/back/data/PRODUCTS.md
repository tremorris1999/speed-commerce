# Product
## Functionality
The products module needs to implement the following behaviors:
- [ ] Retrieve all products matching an optional arbitrary filter (pagination to be explored later).
- [ ] Retrieve an individual product given its ObjectId.
- [ ] Insert a single product into the database and return its newly generated ObjectId.
- [ ] Update a single product given its ObjectId.
- [ ] Delete a single product given its ObjectId.
